# Draw by Night for Coders

Draw by Night is an Vancouverâ€™s only bi-monthly drawing party started by the one and only <a href="http://www.notsosimpleton.com">Myron Campbell</a>. In an effort to encourage and engage the creative coders I have secured a spot for people of this leaning to participate in Draw by Night. This repository is a collection of my examples and experiments that I am preparing ahead of the draw by night event(s).
